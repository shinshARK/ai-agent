## Chapter 1: LLMs
**Date Completed:** 2025-08-31

### Learnings
* Set up a python development environment with `uv` instead of `pip`, which is what i'm familiar with, it's pretty neat.
* Set up a basic Gemini API client, how to setup the API key, how to get a response from it, get usage metadata from response
* A token is usually 4 characters long

### Challenges
* At first i didn't know how to structure main.py and just made something very unstructured, i peeked at the solution files and got the gist of what i should be doing
* Parsing arguments, differentiating user prompt and flag(s) (not sure if we'll add more flags). I wasn't sure how should i do it, but eventually i went with an approach that allows for other flags to be easily used.  

## Questions
* Peeking at the final Lesson 6 solution files they went with a different approach as to print out the user prompt, but when there will be multi-turn chat i feel like my approach could be more flexible, not sure yet in the future how it's gonna work out.

### Key Takeaway 
This chapter made me learn how to properly setup a python dev env with uv, introduced me how to make a basic LLM API Client, and how to interact with the API.
