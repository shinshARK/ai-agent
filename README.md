# AI Agent in Python (Boot.dev Guided Project Course)

This project is a guided implementation of an AI agent, following the curriculum from the **[Build an AI Agent course on Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python)**. The goal is to learn the fundamentals of creating and interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) in a structured way.
